Files to analyze ddRadSeq data collected from the maize weevil, Sitophilus zeamais, in Oaxaca and Chiapas, Mexico.

Find data in Dryad Repository: https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.zpc866tcr

Scripts that end in .sh should be run at the command line. These are written to run the program Stacks (https://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/) for ddRadSeq analysis. All other files are written for R. See/execute script "./scripts/R_scripts/load_libs.R" for a list of packages required to run the code.
